# HF Patch for RoomGirl!
A patch for [RoomGirl](http://www.illusion.jp/preview/roomgirl/) with all free updates, fan-made English translations and essential mods. It will allow you to load all character cards and scenes and give you countless gameplay improvements while still keeping the original, uncluttered and clean feel of the game. All content is tested and fixed (or removed) as needed before each update. HF Patch can repair many common problems, try it if you have issues with your game or mod setup.

Read the [full HF Patch manual](https://gist.github.com/ManlyMarco/31b78470b8e190686c7ed9686c237e3f) to learn more about what it is, what it does, how to use it, and how to solve common issues.

HF Patch does not contain the full game, paid expansions or any other pirated content. You have to buy the game and expansions separately. You can buy the game [on DLsite](https://www.dlsite.com/pro/work/=/product_id/VJ01000419.html) ([buy and download guide](https://youtu.be/gXhEcizjOLg)) or [on DMM](https://dlsoft.dmm.co.jp/detail/illusion_0041pack/) ([buy and download guide](https://youtu.be/SJ9OXedO3qI)).

## Important notes, please read
- HF Patch does not contain the full game, paid expansions or any other pirated content. The full game needs to be already installed for the patch to work.
- If you have installed a previous HF Patch or separate mods it is recommended to remove ALL mods when prompted. This will prevent any potential mod conflicts or outdated mods causing problems.
- All free patches and DLC are included. Paid and limited-access DLCs are not included, but they are optional and not required. 
- You can run this patch as many times as you want and nothing will break. All mods are optional to install, and most can be removed by running the patch again.
- It's recommended to install all content mods if you plan to download character cards - they are required by many cards and scenes.
- You can use this patch to fix many broken game/mod installs.
- Older versions of BepInEx will be automatically upgraded, and most botched installations should get fixed by running this patch.
- Please leave the modders some positive feedback or help them in some other way!
- There is no warranty on this patch or on any of the included mods. You are installing this patch at your own risk.

## How to build
At least Visual Studio 2017 is needed for the helper library and latest unicode Inno Setup compiler is needed for the patch itself. All necessary mods have to be placed inside correct subfolders of the Input directory to compile. Because of massive size, they are not included here.
